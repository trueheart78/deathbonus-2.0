# Go, Deathbonus

[Dexbonus][dexbonus-twitter]-related, JS-powered twitch-related redirector.

## Use Cases

Mobile devices tend to have the Twitch application installed, so I decided to create a simple page
that would allow a viewer to perform the following actions outside of the installed application:

* Subscribing via browser.
* Chatting via browser.
* Watch via application (if installed), otherwise it will load in the browser.

You can also specify the stream, the default is [dexbonus][dexbonus-twitch].
